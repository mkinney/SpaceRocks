Space Rocks (aka Asteroids)

GameMakerStudio2 demo game for learning Game Maker

See [Space Rocks Tutorial](https://marketplace.yoyogames.com/assets/7423/space-rocks-gml) for details.

I struggled to find a good game pad for mac until I found the SteelSeries Nimbus Gamepad:![Nimbus](nimbus.png) The only drawback is that it does not have a "start" button.

I've added a high score and game pad inputs.
